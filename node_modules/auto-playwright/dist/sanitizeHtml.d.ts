/**
 * The reason for sanitization is because OpenAI does not need all of the HTML tags
 * to know how to interpret the website, e.g. it will not make a difference to AI if
 * we include or exclude <script> tags as they do not impact the already rendered DOM.
 *
 * In my experience, reducing HTML only to basic tags produces faster and more reliable prompts.
 *
 * Note that the output of this function is designed to interpret only the HTML tags.
 * For instructions that rely on visual cues (e.g. "click red button") we intend to
 * combine HTML with screenshots in the future versions of this library.
